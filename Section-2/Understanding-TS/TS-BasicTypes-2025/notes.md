## Typescript types
- Javascript has types for values - it just didnt have the concept of explicit type assignment as we have it in TS
- So types themselves are not TypeScript specific - just this idea of enforcing types, setting types explicitly and getting type related errors at the development stage are TypeScript specific

## Typescript configuration
- run tsc --init --> tsconfig.json file is created - allows to configure typescript behavior
-
